# A Systems Neuroscience Approach to Continual 

Abstract of the paper: 

>How can we endow artificial neural networks with the capacity for life-long (i.e., continual) learning? Recently, algorithmic insights into the olfactory (neural) circuit of the *Drosophila Melanogaster* have been discovered that endows it with the ability to acquire novel information, while preserving old memories. In this work, we leverage these algorithmic insights, notably sparse coding via a random projection, a $k$-winner-take-all computation, (partial) synaptic freezing, and associative learning, to build an artificial system with the ability of continual learning.
